## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service, allowing the company to take proactive measures for retention.

This project follows a standard machine learning workflow, including data collection, preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and potential deployment considerations. The code is primarily implemented in Python using libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn, and is designed to be run within a Jupyter Notebook environment for development and testing.

## Business Problem

Customer churn, the rate at which customers stop using a service, is a critical concern for telecommunications companies. High churn rates lead to revenue loss and increased costs associated with acquiring new customers. By accurately predicting which customers are at risk of churning, the company can implement targeted retention strategies, such as offering special discounts or improved services, ultimately reducing churn and improving customer loyalty.

## Data Sources

The model is trained and evaluated using data that typically includes:

* **Customer Account Information:**
    * Contract type (e.g., Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
    * Tenure (number of months the customer has stayed with the company)
    * Monthly charges
    * Total charges
    * Data usage (if available and relevant)
    * Phone service details (e.g., multiple lines, international plan)
    * Internet service details (e.g., DSL, Fiber optic, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support)
    * Streaming TV and movie subscriptions
    * Payment method

* **Customer Interaction Data (Potentially Available):**
    * Call logs (number of calls, duration, issues reported)
    * Support tickets (number of tickets, severity, resolution time)
    * Website activity (pages visited, time spent, actions taken)

* **Demographic Data (Potentially Available):**
    * Age
    * Gender
    * Location (e.g., state, city - used cautiously due to privacy)
    * Partner and dependent status

The specific dataset used for this project (if publicly available or simulated) will be described in the data loading section of the Jupyter Notebook.
